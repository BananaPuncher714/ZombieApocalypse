#if item 1's chance is 5, and item 2's chance is 10 then a number between 1 and 15 will be generated
#item 1 will have 5 chances of those 15 possible numbers to be chosen, and item 2 will have 10 chances.
#Simply put, each item will have that number of chances to be picked out of the sum of all chances.
